        <h2>Reconnect with your partner</h2>
        <p>
          We’ve all been there. It’s the end of the day, the kids are finally
          asleep, and what happens? We sit down on the couch and pick up our
          phones rather than connect with the person right next to us. Putting
          your phone in Aro shows your partner you are truly present with them.

        <h2>Take some well-deserved "me time"</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes we need to quiet the outside voices a little. Aro is your
          reminder that it’s OK to take some time for yourself. That could be
          reading a book, reflecting on the day, or even just getting a good
          night's sleep. You deserve it.
